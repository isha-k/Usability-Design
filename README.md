# Usability-Design

Project involved working in co-ordinated groups to design a usable computer-based system for a diverse range of users and environments. Project helps us examine issues in the design of system interfaces from a number of perspectives: user, programmer, designer. It explores the application of the relevant theories in practice and covers topics such as methods and tools for developing effective user interfaces, evaluation methods such as the conduct of usability and heuristic evaluations, design of appropriate interface elements including the design of menus and other interaction styles. 

Our app idea is a social media cooking app where users are exposed to an interactive cooking feed. The aim of the social media cooking app is to not only encourage users to gain more experience in the kitchen, but also to make mealtimes fun and exciting, all whilst taking into consideration factors such as income and dietary requirements. 
For stage B, our group collected data about our users to try and understand their habits and preferences and in particular, problems and challenges they faced in regard to meal prep and cooking at home. Stage C involved using our findings and Usability models to produce a series of quick sketches which had the aim of attempting to solve userâ€™s primary problem:

In this report, we draw from those sketches and the theory of Usability, to produce a final, high-fidelity prototype.
